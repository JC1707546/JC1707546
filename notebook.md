### Layout and Design Widgets
- How do you center a widget?
- How do you align something to the left or right?
- What widget adds space around content?

At the top, begin a table of contents, Ex.:
## Table of Contents
- [Day 1](#day-1)
  - [Notes](#notes)
  - [Practice](#practice)
- [Day 2](#day-2)

[Notebook Style Guide](#markdown-style-guide-for-coding-notebooks)
## Markdown Style Guide for Coding Notebooks

Follow this guide to keep your coding notebook **clear, consistent, and professional**.  
This ensures your notes are easy for you (and others) to read later.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Headings
**When to use:** Organize your notebook into sections (like days, topics, or projects).  
- `#` for the notebook title (use once at the top).  
- `##` for each day or major topic.  
- `###` for subsections (like "Notes", "Practice", "Reflections").  

âœ… Example:


# My Coding Notebook
## Day 1
### Notes
### Practice

ðŸ”¡ Text Formatting
When to use: Highlight important ideas or add emphasis.

Use bold for key terms or definitions.

Use italic for emphasis or side comments.

Use inline code for keywords, functions, or commands.

 

âœ… Example:

**Class** = a blueprint for objects  
*Remember:* always test your code  
Use `System.out.println()` to print

 

ðŸ’» Code Blocks
When to use: Anytime you write multiple lines of code.

Inline code for short snippets.

Fenced code blocks with language for full examples.

âœ… Example:

```java
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

ðŸ§¾ Lists
When to use: Organize steps, notes, or key points.

Numbered lists for sequences or steps.

Bulleted lists for unordered ideas.

âœ… Example:

1. Define the class
2. Write the main method
3. Test your program

Variables
- Loops
- Conditionals
